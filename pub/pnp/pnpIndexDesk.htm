<b>Policies vs. Procedures</b>
<br />
What's the difference?  
<br /><br />
Simply put, Policies are a guide on "what" to do, while Procedures are a guide on "how" to do it.
<br /><br />
Polices define the rules and guidelines on how the company & it's agents conduct business.  These can involve everything from protecting the agent and company from liability, as well as ensuring we are following applicable laws to serve our clients.  Polices help everyone to operate within the same framework.
<br /><br />
Procedures, on the other hand, explain how to perform certain tasks within that framework.  One of the most important parts of a Procedure Manual is creating a repeatable guide to an end result, so everyone is rowing in the same direction to achieve a common goal.
<br /><br />
Policies and Procedures (P<i>n</i>P) are a living documents that evolve as the need arises.  When you have a question about PnP, always check here first for the most up to date information!
